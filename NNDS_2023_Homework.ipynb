The field of **explanaibility** is concerned with finding algorithms for achieving this. In this homework, you will be guided in implementing some basic explanaibility algorithms (**saliency maps**), which is an instructive way of playing with the TensorFlow autodiff framework.\n",

Try implementing integrated gradients.\n",

One example of such methods is TracIn [5], which stores checkpoints of the model during training and evaluates the correlation of the gradients. Try to implement TracIn or any other metric of data influence.\n",

If you have access to an LLM, you can try it! Take a specific neuron in the model, and collect the activation for multiple examples. Provide these activations to the LLM, and prompt it to provide a human-understandable explanation. What is the result?"
